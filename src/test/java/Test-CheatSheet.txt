JUnit4 Annotations:

@Test
Identifies a method as a test method.

@Before
Executed before each test. It is used to prepare the test environment (e.g., read input data, initialize the class).

@After
Executed after each test. It is used to cleanup the test environment. It can also save memory by cleaning up expensive memory structures.

@BeforeClass
Executed once, before the start of all tests. Methods marked with this annotation need to be defined as static to work with JUnit.

@AfterClass
Executed once, after all tests have been finished. Methods annotated with this annotation need to be defined as static to work with JUnit.


@Ignore
Marks that the test should be disabled.

@Test(expected = Exception.class)
Fails if the method does not throw the named exception.


@Test(timeout = 10)
Fails if the method takes longer than 100 milliseconds.
